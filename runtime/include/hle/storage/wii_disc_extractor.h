// Extracts a Wii disc image into the "sys"/"files" DATA folder layout hle/storage/dvd.cpp expects
// as its DVD root. Supports a plain, uncompressed disc image (ISO/GCM) and a single-file WBFS
// container; RVZ/WIA/CISO/GCZ are out of scope (they need their own decompressors).
//
// Format details (partition table, ticket/title-key decryption, per-cluster data decryption, the
// boot.bin/FST layout) are the long-public Wii disc format, the same one every other disc tool
// (Dolphin included) implements independently from the same public documentation - see
// wiibrew.org's "Wii Disc" and "Wii Ticket" pages. The Wii common key used to decrypt the
// per-title key is likewise long-public (leaked in 2008) and is embedded the same way Dolphin's
// own public source does.
