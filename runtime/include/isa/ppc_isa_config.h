// by NEON, so those files need NO changes at all on arm64 (verified compiling both unchanged
// through this header for arm64-v8a). Vendored at runtime/third_party/sse2neon (MIT, upstream
// github.com/DLTcollab/sse2neon) rather than hand-porting every intrinsic call site individually
// - a sibling ARM64 static-recompilation port of this same upstream project (for Apple platforms)
// took the identical approach for the identical reason.

// instruction, so they're exact per-lane single roundings, matching what the x86 FMA3 path does.

// always_inline for a symbol another translation unit could in principle override ("function
// body can be overwritten at link time") - confirmed hitting this across dozens of generated
// _statefree_v0 shard functions on GCC (devkitA64/Switch). `inline` gives it the ODR's vague/weak
// linkage guarantee instead, which is what always_inline needs to safely apply - harmless
// addition for Clang, which already tolerated the attribute-only form. Other shards that only
// forward-declare these functions (without repeating the attribute or `inline`) are unaffected:
// per the C++ standard, `inline` is a property of the definition, not something every mention
// needs to repeat, and a weak symbol is still emitted for genuinely cross-shard calls.
// `used` is a further belt-and-braces addition on top of the `inline` fix described above: that
// fix's own reasoning ("a weak symbol is still emitted for genuinely cross-shard calls") turned
// out not to hold in practice on devkitA64's GCC 16 - confirmed empirically (nm on the compiled
// .o showed the plain MKW_PPC_NO_INLINE sibling function present but the always_inline one
// missing, from the exact same translation unit, despite both being extern "C" with external
// linkage). `__attribute__((used))` forces GCC to emit code for the function unconditionally,
// sidestepping whatever specific heuristic (visible only via compiled-object inspection, not
// reasoned about correctly from the ODR/weak-linkage rules alone) was still eliding it.
