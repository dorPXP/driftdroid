// Thermal quality scaling: keeps the frame rate up on a hot phone by rendering fewer pixels,
// instead of letting the SoC throttle into a slideshow at full resolution. Android reports how
// close the device is to throttling (PowerManager.getThermalHeadroom, API 31) and the Kotlin side
// forwards it here; see ThermalMonitor.kt.
//
// Only the render resolution moves - never the user's saved setting, and never the game's own
// framebuffer size, which aurora clamps to.
