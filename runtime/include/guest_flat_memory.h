// Flat 4 GiB guest address space: a guest access is just `*(T*)(kFlatGuestBase + addr)` plus a
// byte swap, no page-table load/branch. Two views alias the same physical memory: the GUEST
// view at kFlatGuestBase has page protections as the interception mechanism (unmapped/MMIO/
// executable/deferred-read pages are uncommitted or protected), while the HOST view is a plain
// alias native runtime code (image loading, DVD reads, HLE, GX) writes through unchecked.

// The desktop base (16 TiB, 2^48) assumes a 48-bit (or wider) virtual address space - true on
// Windows/desktop Linux, but NOT universal on Android. Confirmed directly on the user's real
// device (Huawei nova 9, Kirin 985): the kernel silently ignores any mmap hint at or above 2^39
// (redirects to an unrelated low address instead of failing, so this can't be detected any other
// way than trying it) - most ARM64 Android kernels are built with a narrower VA_BITS
// configuration than the CPU itself could support, to save page-table memory; 39-bit is a very
// common choice. 128 GiB (2^37) has real margin below the empirically-found ~2^38 ceiling on
// that device while still being far above where the heap/stack/loaded libraries actually sit, so
// it should generalize to other/narrower-VA Android devices too, though this has only been
// verified on the one device the project can currently test on - if a different Android device
// hits the same "reserve the 4 GiB flat guest address space" runtime error, try successively
// lower values here (0x0000'0010'0000'0000ull and below) and report which one works.

// No fixed base on Switch. Horizon places each process's 8 GiB heap region and 6 GiB alias region
// at random addresses inside the 64 GiB ASLR region, and code/aliased memory (the only kind that
// can carry multiple views - see guest_flat_memory.cpp) may not overlap either of them. Any
// constant 4 GiB window therefore collides on some fraction of launches; hardware showed the heap
// sitting at 0x8e8bc7000, right inside the old 32 GiB constant. Initialize() instead picks a free
// window per launch and publishes it here once, before any translated code runs.
//
// Declared const (with a fixed symbol name) everywhere except guest_flat_memory.cpp, which owns
// the one write. A mutable global could be aliased by any guest memory write (they go through
// uint8_t*), so GCC reloaded it before every single guest access; a const object cannot be
// modified by those writes, which lets each translated function load the base once. Hidden
// visibility removes the extra GOT indirection. Safe because the value is set exactly once,
// before any reader runs, and never changes afterwards.
