// Native THP video/audio decode, replacing the guest's own decoder.
//
// THP is essentially MJPEG, and the guest decoder is the single most expensive thing in the game
// outside a race: profiles put the Select Cup screen at 9 FPS with >55% of the frame inside
// __THPInverseDCTNoYPos / __THPInverseDCTY8 / __THPHuffDecodeDCTComp*, and the attract-mode demo
// at ~72% THP decode. Running it as translated PPC costs roughly six ARM64 instructions per guest
// instruction, so a native decoder is worth far more here than anywhere else in the game.
//
// The decoder itself is aurora's (upstream commit 3251f4e2, "Add aurora::thp implementation"),
// which upstream verified bit-exact against Dolphin for both THPVideoDecode and THPAudioDecode.
// This file is only the guest-ABI shim: guest addresses in, host pointers out.
