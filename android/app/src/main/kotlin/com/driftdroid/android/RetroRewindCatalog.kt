/**
 * Live view of what Retro Rewind releases actually exist right now, read from the same official
 * update.rwfc.net service the mod's own updater uses - instead of only ever knowing about the one
 * release that happened to be hardcoded when the app was built.
 *
 * ## What "auto-detect the newest version" can and can't mean here
 *
 * DriftDroid is a static recompiler, not an emulator: Retro Rewind's game logic lives in
 * RetroRewind6/Binaries/Code.pul, a Kamek PowerPC code file that our translator turns into native
 * ARM code ahead of time, at build time on a desktop (see runtime/generated/build_shards and
 * RecompMod in the runtime). There is no PowerPC interpreter on the device, so a Code.pul this
 * app was never built against simply has no code to run - which is why a blind "always install
 * whatever's newest" would hand players a broken install rather than a new version.
 *
 * What genuinely can be automatic is everything else, and that's what this does:
 *  - the set of releases, their order and their URLs are discovered live, so nothing goes stale;
 *  - compatibility is decided by Code.pul's SHA-256 against [RetroRewindRelease.SUPPORTED_CODE_PUL_SHA256],
 *    NOT by version number - so any future release that leaves Code.pul untouched (an
 *    assets/tracks-only update) is adopted automatically the day it ships, with no app update;
 *  - a release that DOES change Code.pul is detected as unsupported *before* downloading 1.9GB,
 *    by fetching that version's ~700KB delta archive first (see [inspectDelta]), and the player
 *    is told exactly that rather than being silently left on an old version.
 *
 * Every URL is constrained to the official HTTPS hosts below; nothing here will follow a redirect
 * off them.
