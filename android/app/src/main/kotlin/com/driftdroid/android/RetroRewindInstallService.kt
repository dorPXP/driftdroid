/**
 * Runs the ~2GB Retro Rewind copy/extract as a foreground service instead of a plain Thread owned
 * by ModePickerActivity (see git history/session notes: a bare background Thread died the instant
 * Android reclaimed the backgrounded activity's process for memory - a real risk for an operation
 * that realistically takes several minutes and invites the user to go do something else while it
 * runs). A foreground service with an active notification tells Android to treat this process as
 * foreground-priority for the duration, so it survives the Activity being destroyed/recreated and
 * ordinary background memory reclaim. It does NOT survive a force-stop or reboot - that would need
 * WorkManager's durable, persisted work requests, which is a bigger lift than this problem
 * currently warrants (queued as follow-up if it turns out to matter in practice).
 *
 * Progress is published to [RetroRewindInstallStatus] rather than any direct callback, since the
 * whole point is that no particular Activity instance can be assumed to be alive to receive one.
