/**
 * The launcher's UI click sound (res/raw/ui_click.mp3) - a single shared SoundPool rather than a
 * MediaPlayer per tap, since MediaPlayer's startup latency (even for a short clip) is noticeable
 * for a "press this button" sound that needs to feel instant; SoundPool decodes once up front and
 * plays from memory. Lazily created on first use rather than in a static initializer so it only
 * ever needs an Android Context once a screen that actually wants sound has been reached.
